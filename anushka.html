                <p>In 2009, Anushka first starred in the blockbuster hit, the fantasy film Arundhati. In this heroine-centric film, she essayed two roles for the first time.[5] It was a critical as well as commercial success. Critics heaped praise on Anushka for her performance. Idlebrain's Jeevi wrote that she was "simply amazing in two roles" and that she did "exceptionally well with subtle yet impact creating performance",[20] while Rediff claimed that she was "brilliant and breathtaking in parts", labelling Arundhati as "totally Anushka's film".[21] Sify noted that she was "at her best with great performance".[22] She went on to win the Nandi Special Jury Award[23] and the Filmfare Best Actress Award.[24] Her next film was Billa, a remake of the 2007 Tamil film of the same name. The film received mixed reviews, with Rediff stating "Anushka has a super-toned body and indulges in quite a bit of skin show" but had "nothing much to do",[25] while Sify stated "Anushka was there to show her oomph and glamour which she has done full justice".[26] Her final release in 2009 was her second Tamil feature film, the action masala film Vettaikkaran with actor Vijay and it received generally unfavourable reviews. Rediff said, "Anushka, fresh from her success with Arundhathi, has been relegated to pretty bimbette again and appears conveniently during the romantic numbers of which Oru Chinna Thamarai takes the cake."[27] and Sify said, "Anushka has nothing much to do and hence goes unnoticed.</p>
