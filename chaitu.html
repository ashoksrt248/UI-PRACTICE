                <p>Naga Chaitanya Akkineni is an Indian film actor known for his work in Telugu cinema. He debuted in the 2009 film Josh, directed by newcomer Vasu Varma and produced by Dil Raju.[1] Josh was an average grosser. Prior to the release of his first film, he signed his second film with Indira Productions, directed by Gautham Menon.[2] This film Ye Maaya Chesave co-starring Samantha Akkineni released in 2010, and was a critical and commercial success.[3] His next film Sukumar's 100% Love, co-starring Tamannaah was a super success. This was soon followed by the flop Dhada, co-starring Kajal Aggarwal and Bejawada. Chaitanya also appeared in the movie Autonagar Surya.[4] 2014 saw him in the blockbuster Manam. In 2016, he starred in two films, the hit romance drama Premam, co-starring Shruti Haasan, and the average running thriller Sahasam Swasaga Sagipo.[5] In 2017, he starred in Rarandoi Veduka Chudham, which became his highest grosser of the year. In 2019, he starred in the blockbuster romantic drama Majili alongside his wife Samantha Akkineni.</p>
                <p>Chaitanya debuted in 2009 with the film Josh, directed by Vasu Varma, in which he played a college student. Rediff.com wrote: "As a debutant, Naga Chaitanya has performed well. He has his moments where he's proven himself. There is always scope for improvement and one hopes that he will hone his skills in the years to come."[13] Chaitanya won the Filmfare Award South for Best Male Debut.</p>
                <p>He next starred in the romantic drama Ye Maaya Chesave, directed by Gautham Menon, which was simultaneously shot in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, with a different cast and climax. He played the role of a Hindu Telugu assistant director who falls in love with a Christian Malayali girl. A reviewer from Sify.com wrote: "Naga Chaitanya is at home in romantic scenes. His asset is his voice and his casual acting style. Chaitanya has improved his performance from his first film. He can now confidently act in more romantic films and strengthen his position." However, the reviewer felt that he should concentrate on his looks as he felt that Chaitanya looked "very boyish".The film was a m hit at the box office and went on to receive a cult status.He also received a nomination for Filmfare Award South for Best Actor Male.</p>
                <p>After Ye Maaya Chesave, he paired up with Sukumar for another love story titled 100% Love, in which he played the role of a studious and egotistical college student who is the top ranker of his college. IndiaGlitz wrote: "Naga Chaitanya's action has improved from his previous films. Though his expressions fall flat at places, the music, characterization, camera and the look covers it all. His timing and grasping of his role is commendable. Though he didn't impress with his action, he didn't depress either. His best is perhaps yet to come." However, the reviewer opined that Chaitanya should improve his dancing skills</p>
