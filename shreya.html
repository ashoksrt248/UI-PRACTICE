                <p>Shriya Saran (pronounced [ʂrɪjaː sərən] (born as Shriya Saran Bhatnagar on 11 September 1982),[4] also known as Shriya, is an Indian actress and model known for her work in South Indian cinema, Bollywood and American cinema. Saran was born in Dehradun and spent most of her childhood in Haridwar. In 2001, her dance master gave her the opportunity to appear in Renoo Nathan's debut music video "Thirakti Kyun Hawa", which brought Saran to the attention of many Indian filmmakers. Although Saran aspired to become a well-known dancer, she was offered a leading role. Thus, Saran made her film debut in 2001 with the Telugu film Ishtam, and had her first commercial success with Santhosham (2002).</p>
                <p>She subsequently appeared in several more Telugu films while making in-roads in the Hindi and Tamil industries. In 2007, Saran starred in Sivaji, the highest-grossing Tamil film at that time. She also gained critical acclaim for her role in the 2007 Bollywood film Awarapan. In 2008, Saran played the lead role in her first English film, the American-Indian co-production The Other End of the Line. Her following projects included popular films such as Kanthaswamy (2009) in Tamil and Pokkiri Raja (2010) in Malayalam — roles that established her as one of the leading actresses in the South Indian film industries.[5] In 2012, she was cast in the British–Canadian film Midnight's Children, under the direction of Deepa Mehta, based on Salman Rushdie's Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, for which she received international critical acclaim. She achieved further commercial success by starring in films such as Pavitra (2013) and Chandra (2013). In 2014, Saran starred in the critically acclaimed Telugu film Manam, which brought her accolades for her performance.</p>
                <p>In addition to her work in films, Saran has been the brand ambassador for brands across India, endorsing beauty and health products. Among other philanthropic activities, she has volunteered for charity organizations. In 2011 she opened a spa employing exclusively visually challenged people. She was also the brand ambassador for Celebrity Cricket League for its two first seasons</p>
                <p>Saran's first film of 2014, released May 23, was the Telugu family drama Manam,[67] which was a success in India and America. Saran's first film of 2015 was Gopala Gopala, a remake of the Bollywood blockbuster Oh, My God, released in the January festive season. She will next appear in director Karan Bhutani's Hindi film Valmiki Ki Bandook, which is currently under production.[68] She appeared opposite Ajay Devgan in Drishyam, a remake of the Malayalam film of the same name, which turned out to be a box office success.[69] In mid-January 2016, she made a special appearance in Nagarjuna's Oopiri, while also signing for her next Hindi film Tadka, opposite Nana Patekar.[70] In May 2016, she was selected as a female lead in Balakrishna's 100th film Gautamiputra Satakarni</p>
