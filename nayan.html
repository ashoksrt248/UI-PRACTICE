                <p>In 2010, she also made her Kannada film debut through the film Super,[9] her only appearance in a Kannada film to date. Her portrayal of Sita in Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Telugu Actress and the Nandi Award for Best Actress. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actress for her performance in Raja Rani (2013), Naanum Rowdy Dhaan (2015) and Aramm (2017).

A remake of the same-titled 1980 Tamil film, it went on to become a success at the box office[vague],[38] while Nayanthara received many accolades for her performance as Sasha in her new glamour look.[39] Sify heaped praise on her, describing her as a "show stopper". The reviewer further wrote: "Nayanthara has gone full throttle to look her sexiest best [...] She has a beautiful body which she flaunts daringly [...] and is also able to bring out the cold aloofness and bitterness of her character.[40] Similarly a critic from Nowrunning.com noted that she looked "great in mini-skirts, jacket, dark glasses and tall boots".</p>
