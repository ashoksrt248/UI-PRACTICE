                <p>Trisha Krishnan (born 4 May 1983),[7] known mononymously as Trisha, is an Indian film actress and model, who primarily works in Tamil films, where she has established herself as a leading actress. She was noticed after winning several beauty pageants like the Miss Madras contest (1999), which marked her entry into filmdom.</p>
                <p>After appearing in a supporting role in the 1999 Tamil film Jodi, she had her first lead role in the 2002 film Mounam Pesiyadhe. She later rose to fame starring in the successful films, Saamy (2003) and Ghilli (2004) in Tamil cinema and Varsham (2004) in Telugu cinema,[8] for which she secured her first South Filmfare Best Actress Award. She went on to win the award two more times for Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana (2005) and Aadavari Matalaku Ardhalu Verule (2007). In 2010, she made her Bollywood début in Khatta Meetha.[9] She was seen in her career best performances in Abhiyum Naanum (2008), Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010) for which she won Vijay Award for Favourite Heroine and was nominated for Filmfare Best Tamil Actress Award.</p>
                <p>In 2004, she débuted in Telugu cinema with M S Raju's romance-action film Varsham, which turned her into an overnight sensation. Critics lauded her performance as Sailaja, a middle-class girl who becomes a film star on her father's insistence; Jeevi from Idlebrain claimed that she was "beautiful" and a "big plus to the film", labelling her performance as "natural",[29] while Sify noted that she had "transformed herself into a fine actress with immense screen presence".[30] A critic from fullhyderabad.com praised her, citing that she had shown why Tamil Nadu was "busy building her a temple", further adding that she looked "so fresh and fine, you feel like gifting her to the roses".[31] While the film was highly commercially successful, running for over 175 days theatres,[32] being declared a "sensational hit" and becoming one of the highest-grosser of the year,[33] Trisha was given the Telugu Filmfare</p>
                <p>Her 2009 films Sarvam with Arya and Sankham opposite Gopichand did not do well and became just average grosser. Trisha had a major role, starring as a Syrian Christian Malayali girl Jessie, in Gautham Menon's 2010 Tamil romantic drama film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, which was a big commercial success at the box office.[55][56] The film centres around the complicated relationship between a Syrian Christian Malayali girl and a Tamil Hindu assistant director, who falls in love with her, only to be met by her indifference and reluctance as they belong to different religions and her strict conservative family will never consent to their marriage.[57] Her performance was well received by critics,[58] earning her the 2010 Vijay Award for Favourite Heroine.[59] Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented, "Trisha is a revelation. Shorn of her filmi make-up, she dazzles in Nalini Sriram's simple costumes."[60] Sify remarked, "Trisha looks good and delivers her career best performance in a knock-out role.</p>
