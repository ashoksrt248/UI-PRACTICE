                <p>Soundarya Sathyanarayana (18 July 1971 â€“ 17 April 2004)[2] was an Indian actress and producer who worked predominantly in Telugu films and few Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi films in lead roles.</p>
                <p>In 2002, she received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film as producer for the Kannada film Dweepa. She received two Karnataka State Film Awards for Best Actress, several Filmfare Awards South and the Nandi Awards for her performances in films such as Ammoru (1994), Anthapuram (1998), Raja (1999), Dweepa (2002) and Aaptamitra (2004).[3][4] At the peak of her career, Soundarya died in an aircraft crash near Bangalore on 17 April 2004, when she was on her way to Andhra Pradesh to campaign for the Bharatiya Janata Party.[5][6] Soundarya's first movie was the Kannada movie Gandharva in 1992, produced and directed by Hamsalekha. In the same year, she entered Telugu movies ("Tollywood") through the movie Raithu Bharatham opposite Krishna</p>
                <p>Soundarya's first movie was the Kannada film Gandharva in 1992. Then in the same year, she acted in the Telugu movie Raithu Bharatham, opposite superstar Krishna, directed by Tripuraneni Sriprasad alias Varaprasad. She made more than 120 movies, predominantly in Telugu, in a span of 12 years. Telugu actor Venkatesh once described her as "a thorough actress" of Indian cinema</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the critical success of Chudalani Vundi, directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along Kamal Haasan and Prabhudeva in Kaathala Kaathala in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as Navvandi Lavvandi, directed by Singeetam Srinivas. Pelli Peetalu and Sri Ramulayya, Ninne Premista in Telugu and Doni Saagali in Kannada were commercially highly successful. Anthapuram, directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State Nandi Award for Best Actress and also her second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Actress. The producers and directors realized Soundarya's ability to be a crowd puller and the biggest plus for the promotion of the movie. Her 1999 release Raja, opposite Venkatesh, was another blockbuster and won her her third Filmfare Award. Her other releases, Padayappa opposite Rajinikanth, Azad opposite Nagarjuna and Premaku Velayera, Premaku Swagatam and Arundathi further solidified her position. In the same year, she starred opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Sooryavansham, which was one of the few failures of her career, and prevented her from entering into the Bollywood business.</p>
