However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[13] In 2011, Mr. Perfect, another romantic comedy.The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.</p>
